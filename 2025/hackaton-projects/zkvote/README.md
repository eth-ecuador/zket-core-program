## What do you plan to achieve with your project?

The project was made to experiment with ZK information exchange inside a voting system, intended for small and medium groups. The project is applicable for some special circumstances even I can find myself in, so this project will be a proof of concept that might be develloped into something.

## Lessons Learned (For Submission)

- AI tools helped me a lot to implement my ideas through programming language I don't know. I now know the capabilities of GitHub Copilot and I already use this knowledge extensively elsewere. For the future development of the project, I would deepen the inverse engineering, understand the functionality better and try to improve it myself.
- For the next time I would not use so many dependencies. Though they're needed to establish network connections, I would invest more time into brainstorming ideas that involve a more optimized way.
- The next time I'll use Docker, to include all dependencies and make the install easier. Now I don't know how to use it, but learning it would be the goal to improve this project too.
