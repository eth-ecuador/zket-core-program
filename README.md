## Program Overview

- **Focus:** Programmable Cryptography (ProgCrypto), with a special emphasis on Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), privacy, and secure computation.
- **Objective:** To train and empower the next generation of ZK experts in Ecuador.
- **Duration:** **6 intensive weeks.**
- **Cost:** **Free**, thanks to the ZK Education Team of the Ethereum Foundation.

## Learning Content (6-Week Weekly Syllabus)

### Week 1: Fundamentals and Open Source Culture
